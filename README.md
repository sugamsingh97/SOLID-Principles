# SOLID Principles Implementation

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

### Key aspects of this SRP implementation:

#### Clear Separation of Concerns:
- Membership class handles membership operations
- FileLogger class manages error logging
- Each class has exactly one reason to change

#### Focused Responsibilities:
- Membership: Managing membership data
- FileLogger: Handling error logging to file system

#### Benefits:
- Enhanced maintainability
- Easier testing
- Better code organization
- Reduced coupling

#### Design Features:
- Static utility class for logging
- Clean error handling
- Clear class boundaries
- Modular structure

#### This implementation delivers:
- Clear code organization
- Easy maintenance
- Simple testing
- Focused functionality
- Scalable architecture

## Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

### Key aspects of this OCP implementation:

#### Base Class Design:
- Membership class provides core functionality
- Virtual methods enable extension points
- Original code remains unchanged when adding new features

#### Extension Mechanism:
- ProMembership extends base functionality
- Uses inheritance to add new behavior
- Maintains existing interfaces and contracts

#### Benefits:
- Easy to add new membership types
- Existing code remains stable
- Reduces risk of bugs in existing functionality
- Promotes code reuse

#### Best Practices:
- Clear separation of core and extended functionality
- Use of virtual methods for extensibility
- Clean inheritance hierarchy

#### This implementation enables:
- Easy addition of new membership types
- Stable core functionality
- Flexible behavior modification
- Maintainable codebase
- Clear extension points

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

### Key aspects of this LSP implementation:

#### Proper Inheritance:
- ProMembership and PlusMembership correctly extend Membership
- Each derived class maintains the base class contract
- Behavior remains consistent with base class expectations

#### Smart Interface Usage:
- TrialMembership demonstrates proper design by implementing only ITraining
- Avoids forcing inheritance when full substitutability isn't possible
- Shows interface segregation working with LSP

#### Substitutability:
- All derived classes can be used wherever base class is expected
- No unexpected behaviors when using derived classes
- Maintains type safety and contract adherence

#### Clean Design:
- Clear hierarchy of responsibilities
- Proper use of virtual methods for extensibility
- Demonstrates when to use inheritance vs interface implementation

#### This implementation showcases:
- Correct application of LSP
- Clean inheritance hierarchies
- Smart interface usage
- Type-safe substitutability
- Maintainable and extensible code structure

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

### Key aspects of this ISP implementation:

#### Interface Hierarchy:
- ITraining: Basic training functionality
- IMembership: Extends ITraining with membership features
- ILiveTraining: Extends IMembership with live training capabilities

#### Segregated Responsibilities:
- Each interface handles specific functionality
- Classes can implement only the interfaces they need
- TrialMembership only implements ITraining, demonstrating interface segregation

#### Flexible Implementation:
- Different membership types can override specific behaviors
- Clients can work with exactly the interface they need
- Clean separation of concerns through interface segregation

#### Usage Examples:
- Shows how different clients can use different interface combinations
- Demonstrates type safety and feature access control
- Illustrates proper interface segregation in action

#### This implementation enables:
- Modular code structure
- Flexible feature combinations
- Clear client contracts
- Easy maintenance and extensions
- Type-safe feature access

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

### Key points about this DIP implementation:

- The high-level Membership class depends on the ILogger abstraction, not concrete implementations
- The low-level FileLogger and ConsoleLogger classes also depend on the ILogger abstraction
- Dependencies are injected through constructor injection
- The code demonstrates loose coupling - we can easily swap logging implementations
- There's one DIP violation in the Add() method that should be fixed by using the injected logger

### To fix the DIP violation in the Add() method, replace:
```csharp
FileLogger fg = new FileLogger();
fg.LogError(ex.Message);
'''

with:

'''csharp
logger.LogError(ex.Message);
'''
